# CodeRed-CSHaters

This project was made for CodeRED Hackathon 2022. Hosted in Houston Tx @ University of Houston.
This project was made with the help of [Sarah Odigie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-odigie-0362021b4/), [Haley Heyman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haley-heyman/), [Cairo Adanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cairo-a-aa12821a5/), and I, [John Cox](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncox-dev/)  

Our group chose to work on the [PROS](https://pros.com/) e-commerce track. Our website made using HTML and CSS allowed users to view the look and feel for our website that was focused on getting styles of clothing you may have never heard of. 

### After thoughts
After the hackathon, we all gave our inputs on what we could have done to improve the server. Things we would all to love learn or dive deeper into.
- An API that would allow us to add/remove/change clothing into our website
- An algorthm that would check for popularity within social medias to keep track of up and newcoming trends.
- A search engine within the website
